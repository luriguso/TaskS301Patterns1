# 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

In this practice, we will learn to identify and build programs using design patterns. The use of design patterns is fundamental for building extensible and reusable software. The Java language, as well as all software frameworks, are built according to the most important software design patterns.

## Level 1 - Singleton
Create a class that replicates the behavior of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow options to be entered via the console.

The 'Undo' class must store the latest commands entered. It must allow adding or removing commands, as well as listing the latest commands (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).  
The 'Undo' class must necessarily implement the Singleton pattern.

## Level 2 - Abstract Factory
Create a small manager for international addresses and phone numbers.

The application must allow adding addresses and international phone numbers to the address book. Taking into account the different formats of each country, build the address book, addresses, and phone numbers using an Abstract Factory pattern.

## Level 3 - Command
Design a parking lot with 4 vehicles: a car, a bicycle, an airplane, and a boat.

Show how the Command pattern works by implementing the methods: start, accelerate, and brake for each type of vehicle.

## Objectives
Learn to identify and apply software construction patterns.
